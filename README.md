tuckerd.py - Malcolm Tucker Daemon
===================================

An angry scotsman that lives in your machine!

This script is a, well... I guess it could loosely be called a Honeypot.

A highly profane Honeypot.

Designed to look like a telnetd, malcolm will abuse the remote connecting party in very colourful ways.

Plans are to make

 - an SMTP version. Abuse spammers

 - an FTP version. Abuse random skiddies.

 - Whatever else other protocol {china,russia,iran} is trying to break into today.

An ultimate goal i guess would to be something like kippo, but instead of the orly owl, just a lot of profanity.

This was something i threw together in about 30 minutes out of boredom and watching The Thick of It clips on YouTube.

Respect and cultivate your inner malcolm tucker.
